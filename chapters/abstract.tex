Similarly to another professions, programmers create their own working style. It can be characterized by
different phases of the day, splitting tasks into a few chunks, taking breaks, or focusing on a few
projects at the same time. In this thesis, I analyze if there exist links between programmers preferences
and the spectre of their duties for example, if it is true that front-end programmers work usually in the
evenings. For this purpose, I conduct a research scheme on a sample of programmers with the help of a self-created software tool for gathering anonymized data (including the number of projects, time of
activities, programming languages or particular frameworks usage). The end result of this thesis, are the
conclusions from the analysis of the aforementioned data with included visualizations. The tool used
in the thesis is shared publicly for the willing actors to independently verify my end results by
re-running the experiments or running new ones to gather new information for example about potential
improvements in programmers efficiency.
