\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor dr Robert DÄ…browski for great guidance during seminars.
Your help with the contact with the university administration, facilitating the gathering of data or
providing me with useful tips was invaluable. The same I can say about prof. Krzysztof Stencel whose
help was essential.

Apart from the leaders of the seminars, I must mention my colleagues who were also present during my
presentations like I was during theirs. My work would not be the same without their input during our
discussions.

I am grateful for the Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Informatics of the University of Warsaw
for being able to study Computer Science here.

Lastly, my thanks go to my friends and family.
