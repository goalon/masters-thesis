\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor PhD Robert DÄ…browski for expert guidance during the "Software Optimization, Visualization and Analysis" (SOVA) seminars. His help in the university administrative procedures involving this thesis and overall assistance and patience in overcoming various obstacles was invaluable. Another lecturer present during the seminars was Prof. Krzysztof Stencel who provided me with essential advice which I appreciate greatly.

Apart from the leaders of the seminars, I must mention my colleagues who were present at my presentations. This was the time when we shared our remarks on each other's work. My thesis would not be the same without their input during these discussions.

I am grateful for the Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Informatics of the University of Warsaw for being able to study Computer Science and conduct my research there.

Lastly, my thanks go to my friends and family.
