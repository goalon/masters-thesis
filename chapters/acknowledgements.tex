\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\textcolor{red}{TODO}

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor PhD Robert Dąbrowski for expert guidance during the "Software Optimization, Visualization and Analysis" (SOVA) seminars. His help in the university administrative procedures involving this thesis and overall assistance and patience in overcoming various obstacles was invaluable. 
% patience, many tips, critical insight

Another lecturer present during the seminars was Prof. Krzysztof Stencel who provided me with essential advice which I appreciate greatly. I also thank for his attempts at help in gathering the data for me.

Apart from the leaders of the seminars, I must mention my colleagues who were present at my presentations. This was the time when we shared our remarks on each other's work. My thesis would not be the same without their input during these discussions.

I especially thank (highlight from my colleagues) Małgorzata E. Z. Galińska (née Biegała) for testing and assistance with debugging of my addon.
% for being the first to test

My former employers and dear friends M. Asberg (CEO NewNative) and R. Dembkowski (CEO RadCode) for the help with gathering the data.
% and every employee who decided to share the data
% using their professional contacts and oportunities

I thank everyone who decided to share their data with me to proceed with my research project.

I am grateful for the Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Informatics of the University of Warsaw for being able to study Computer Science and conduct my research there.

Lastly, my thanks go to my friends and family for their immense patience and unwavering support (also financial and emotional).
