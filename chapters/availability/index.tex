\chapter{Data and code availability}\label{ch:publishing}

In order to streamline my processes and make them more appealing to the public and to mitigate the risk of de-anonymization \cite{Nar08DeAnon}, a part of the agreement was not to publish any keystroke data of my testing subjects. At GitHub I have published the source code of \href{https://github.com/goalon/time-tracking}{my plugin}, the source code available for \href{https://github.com/goalon/time-tracking-analysis}{data analysis} and the Latex source code of \href{https://github.com/goalon/masters-thesis}{this thesis}. Anyone also can download my plugin directly from VS Code or at \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MateuszBajorekMIMUW.mimuw-mb-tt-time-tracking}{Visual Studio Marketplace} \ref{fig:marketplace}.
